# ARTSbassadors

In 2023, all Northlanders take on the role of ARTSbassadors as they join in the monthly Aesthetics experiences.

As we aligned this journey to the Applause 2023- Summer Soir√©e, our ARTSbassadors accumulated stamps in hope of participating in the Golden Ticket event in Semester 2.

In February, we brought the students to a Magical setting.  The teachers designed related craft activities and some students came forth and did keyboard and ballet recitals during recess.  We also invited a magician for a show.

In March, we had a theme of Costumes and Words.  The students participated in the making of crowns and used this prop and dressed up as a royal to say some lines to their peers during recess.  They also learnt the importance of costumes and lines in a mini stage experience during their recesses.  Some of them also joined in a Garageband session as they created lyrics and sang them with the digital music created.  

Lastly in May, we designed the activities using Animals as the main focus.

The ARTSbassaddors had a chance to experience multi-sensory stations and guess which animal it was.  We also had a mindfulness colouring exercise and used the Quiver app to bring the animals they have coloured to life.

And our upper primary students practised on calligraphy and danced to a hip-hop dance session after school.

# Learning Fiesta

“O this learning, what a thing it is!” In the words of William Shakespeare, our students had a blast learning about him during the Learning Fiesta.

The students spent four days learning beyond the curriculum during their English periods. Reading up on the Bard, writing acrostic poems and sonnets, performing the class Readers’ Theatre and even dressing up as their favourite book characters were some of the exciting activities that the students took part in.

Not only that, the P5 students had a wonderful experience in the Escape Room where English and Mathematics departments worked closely together to come up with the activities for the students to apply what they had learnt during Learning Fiesta.

The Science Fair showcased a wide range of science experiments from aerodynamics to density and acidity. Throughout the day, selected Science Monitors were on hand to explain the science behind the various activities and exhibits. They engaged their peers and helped them understand the underlying principles of the different experiments.

One of the highlights of the event was the toy showcase on the use of forces. This exhibit demonstrated how different forces such as gravity and friction can be used to create exciting and fun toys.

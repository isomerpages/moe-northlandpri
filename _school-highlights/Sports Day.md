# Return of Sports Day!Â 

The resumption of Sports Day after 3 years of hiatus was warmly welcomed by all. Everyone at the stadium could feel the electrifying atmosphere elevated by a plethora of action-pack activities on the track. All who were in the thick of actions enjoyed loads of fun going through immersive experience visibly hungry for more.

Multiple sequences were dovetailed to uplift the adrenaline pumping day, amplified and activated by the loud roars and energising cheers of our house members throughout the meet. It was indeed a tired but extrembly memorable day, missed but deeply felt upon the return of the biggest sports event of the year.

The atmosphere in the hall was electrifying with the colourful presentations by our students, staff, alumni and parents to bring out the theme : Empowered to Learn, Enabled to Lead. All the performers demonstrated much grace and finesse in their melodious voices and dance moves blending the medley of songs in sync with the pulsating beats.

Energetic and elated expressions were also felt at the Basketball court with the overwhelming participation of children setting up and patronizing the games booths which raised the carnival atmosphere to another notch. Our students were thrilled with the student-initiated Game booths being fully engaged in their try outs including having a sculpture balloon or popular snack as takeaways.

The completion of our plastic lighthouse installation by Associate Professor Faishal and Former Principals with the lights shining brightly through the bottles marked the end of a grand celebrative event exuding much pride and nostalgia. It was indeed a sweet family celebration for all, a heartening experience to be remembered.

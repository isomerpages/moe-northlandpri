#### Presenting to you...

NPS30 Anniversary Logo is designed by alumni, Mr Shaun Koo, Class of 1998, 6A3, Form Teacher Mrs Veronica Mui.

"My logo design was inspired by the rising sun in our school crest which represents the glowing spirit of Northland Primary School.  The lighthouse is a metaphor for the school and teachers who are shining beacons of light in guiding the students.  With the sky as the limit and light as a guide, the blue and yellow symbolise infinite possibilities for the future."

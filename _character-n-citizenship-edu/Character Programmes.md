## CHARACTER PROGRAMMES

#### Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)

The heart of the learning in Northland Primary is encapsulated in its vision Firm Foundations, Future Learnings. Firm Foundations focuses on deep learning for understanding in both the academic subjects as well as character development. It reflects the school’s belief in laying a firm foundation to prepare students for life.  
  
A successful student is not only strong in his academic studies but more importantly, he has good character rooted in sound values. The CCE department is committed to bring out the best potential in every child in a safe and nurturing environment for him or her to grow holistically through the Head, Hand and Heart approach. This school wide approach is adopted to ensure that every child grows up to be morally upright and useful citizen; who willingly gives back to others, be it to families, school or to the community; a socially responsible individual.

#### GOAL

The goal of CCE department is to develop students to be good individuals and useful citizens. Various programmes have been introduced to inculcate values, habits, competencies and skills in them. Students learn these through instructions, skills, practice, role modelling by teachers and peers and positive reinforcement during structured time and teachable moments.

#### GUIDING PRINCIPLES

1 \. Every Teacher a CCE Teacher  
  
Every teacher is responsible to see that every child in Northland Primary develops into active citizens of good character. Teachers are role models and will create learning opportunities for students to develop holistically. In addition, a caring and positive teacher-student relationship will develop when there is mutual respect and positive reinforcements. In Northland, deliberate structure such as U and Me Time provides opportunity for teachers to get to know the students in depth for a better teacher-student relationship.  
  
2 \. Values are both taught and caught  
  
Values are both taught and caught. Taught values are those that are explicitly stated in CCE learning outcomes while values that are caught are role models by others, be it teachers or peers. Hence creating a positive school culture and environment and developing a trusting and warm relationship are important for positive values to thrive. Values are taught during curriculum times such as FTGP, assembly periods, CCE lessons as well as during informal platforms such CCE pre-assembly talks and Circle Time sessions. Teachers use teachable moments to teach values too.  
  
3 \. Student Centric – Creating a Holistic Experience  
  
The primary focus in teaching and learning character is the students. Northland school culture is safe and caring for a holistic development to take place. Students will participate actively, be a team player and more importantly construct meaning and understanding into learning character. Students are given opportunities to work in collaboration and own their learning and be self-directed learners. Teachers are facilitators to their students’ learning. The CCE programmes provide authentic learning experiences such as Values in Action, Student-Initiated projects for students to apply the values they have learnt into context. This application of values in real life will help students to internalise and appreciate these values better especially through interaction and socialisation.  
  
4 \. Partnership – Engaging Home and Community  
  
Parents are still children’s number one educator. Parents and school have to work in collaboration for better character development amongst the students. In addition, there are deliberate efforts to create opportunities for students to apply what they have learnt to meaningful and authentic learning experiences through collaboration with strategic partners both locally and overseas in projects that are student centric and values-driven. Values in action like Kindness @ Home and Kindness @ Community serves to meet that purpose. This is followed by reflection activity where questions are crafted using the ORID tool to bring out the learning.

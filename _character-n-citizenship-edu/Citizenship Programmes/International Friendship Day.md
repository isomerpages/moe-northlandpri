## INTERNATIONAL FRIENDSHIP DAY

Over the years, International Friendship Day (IFD) has become an important way for us to celebrate the spirit of friendship and collaboration among different people.

International Friendship Day is a day dedicated to the understanding of Singaporeâ€™s relations with neighbouring countries and beyond. Commemorating International Friendship Day reminds pupils that each country has a rich and diverse history, and a culture distinct to itself.

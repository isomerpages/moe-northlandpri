## P4 NE IMMERSION CAMP

The Character and Citizenship (CCE) Camp is an annual camp organised for the Primary 4 pupils. The camp provides students with a rich learning experience to foster camaraderie and bonding amongst friends of different races and academic abilities, and develops a sense of belonging to the community.

 The camp aims to develop among our students, a sense of identity, pride and self-respect as Singaporeans by understanding Singapore's unique challenges, constraints and vulnerabilities, which make us different from other countries.
 
 Some of the activities are:
 
 *   Ethnic meals 
*   Ice-breaker games that reinforce NE values
*   Traditional exercises like ‘Wushu’ and ‘Silat’
*   Small group discussions on National Issues
*   Gallery walk (viewing of fellow campers’ work)
*   Demonstration and hands-on activities on ‘Total Defence’ 
*   Exploration of the Yishun Neighbourhood (Places of Worship)

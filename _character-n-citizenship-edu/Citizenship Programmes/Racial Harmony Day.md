## RACIAL HARMONY DAY

Singapore is a nation made up of people of many races and cultures. It is essential and relevant that all Singaporeans live in harmony to ensure continued peace and prosperity that we have enjoyed for many years.

It was on 21 July 1964 that Singapore saw racial riots. Racial Harmony Day serves to remind our pupils that:

*   It is important for us to be friends with people of other races and religions
*   In Singapore, people are treated equally regardless of their race and religion
*   It is important to appreciate the different cultures that make up Singapore

## TOTAL DEFENCE DAY

Total Defence Day falls on 15 February, the day Singapore fell to the Japanese in 1942 during World War II. This is to remind Singaporeans that we should not take our current security and success for granted. Â 

As part of the commemoration, an Emergency Evacuation Exercise was also held for Primary 1 to 6 pupils.

Everyone has a part to play in Total Defence. We need to stay vigilant and not be complacent. We should learn to stay positive and turn challenges into opportunities.

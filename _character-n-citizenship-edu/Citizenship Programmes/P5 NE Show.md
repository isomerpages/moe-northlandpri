## P5 NE SHOW

As part of the National Education programme, all P5 students are given a special preview of the NDP 2015.

The objectives of the event are as follow:

a)    to evoke a sense of patriotism amongst students

b)    to instill in students the significance of National Day

c)    to develop a commitment towards the nation and the community

Singapore’s story is a tale of defying all expectations, overcoming all odds and punching above our weight. Singapore is where we are today because of the contributions of our pioneers, and shall continue to progress as Singaporeans unite to scale greater heights. Hence, this is why for our nation’s Golden Jubilee celebrations, the chosen theme for NDP 2015 is Majulah Singapura, or Onward Singapore!

This year, the NE Show will be held at the Padang.

All P5 students are required to attend the NE Show. Students are to come dressed in their camp T-shirt (given during P5 Camp) and school shorts/skirt.

Parents can wait in the canteen, and upon announcement, you can fetch your child from the hall after students have arrived and accounted for.

## P4 CCE CAMP

#### P4 CCE Camp

The Character and Citizenship (CCE) Camp is an annual camp organised for the Primary 4 pupils. The camp provides students with a rich learning experience to foster camaraderie and bonding amongst friends of different races and academic abilities, and develops a sense of belonging to the community.  
  
The camp aims to develop among our students, a sense of identity, pride and self-respect as Singaporeans by understanding Singapore's unique challenges, constraints and vulnerabilities, which make us different from other countries.  
  
The P4 students will experience rich learning from various activities such as Beach Cleaning, Learning Journey to Places of Worship, Career Guidance Talk, Amazing Race, Photo Editing and the most awaited Cheer Competition. These activities are aimed at empowering students to be self-directed, compassionate, resilient and responsible life-long learners.

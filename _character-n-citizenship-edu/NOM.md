## NOM

“Our education system must …nurture Singapore citizens of good character, so that everyone has the moral resolve to withstand an uncertain future, and a strong sense of responsibility to contribute to the success of Singapore and the well-being of fellow Singaporeans.” – Mr Heng Swee Keat, Minister for Education (2011-2014).  
  
Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) has always been at the heart of Singapore’s education system. In CCE, our students learn to be responsible to family and community; and understand their roles in shaping the future of our nation.  
  
Northland Primary School places equal importance to Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) as with other subjects. The Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Department has awarded students who display our school core values for the month – known as Northlander of The Month. The school core values are Compassion, Lifelong Learning, Integrity, Teamwork and Excellence (C-LITE values). The awardees are selected by the class form teacher. The core value that was focused for January to February 2015 was on Compassion. Positive role models and activities to promote self-reflection during Circle Time and Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) will further help nurture the right character.  
  
The names of students who were awarded NOM are listed in the school website and the noticeboard outside the library to affirm and serve as inspiration and role model to other students.

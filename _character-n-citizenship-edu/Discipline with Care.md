## DISCIPLINE WITH CARE

The discipline culture in Northland Primary School adopts a positive and proactive approach towards discipline. The school believes that good discipline facilitates teaching and learning in the class and creates a positive environment for a Northland child to develop into a morally upright individual who is able to make sound moral judgement in his or her daily lives for the benefit of oneself as well as society. The “Discipline with Care” framework that is being adopted by the school approaches discipline in the following ways:

1 \.  Support  <br>
2 \.  Teach  <br>
3 \.  Exercise  <br>
4 \.  Re-direct

**Support** <br>
Character building is given equal importance when compared to the academics.  
  
The school adopts a positive approach towards correcting misbehaviour and affirming positive behaviour through Public Affirmation Private Correction (PAPC). Periodically updates on corrective actions that the school has undertaken will be made known to all students through pre/assembly talks. This is to assure the masses that the school takes discipline seriously.

**Teach** <br>
Continuous reminders through structured and teachable moments on CLITE values, SEL Competencies, Acts of Kindness and I-Care Tagline. This is taken up by school leaders, teachers and all support staff such as FTSC as well as AED LBS.  
  
**Exercise** <br>
Students are given opportunities to develop good behaviour because through practice they will eventually develop the habit of positive behaviour. This is done through programmes such as Values-In-Action and Student-Initiated Projects.  
  
The Restorative Practice approach adopted during detention class allows students to set achievable goals for themselves to make amends for their wrong doings.

**Re-direct** <br>
Students also learn to rechannel their energy to constructive actions when they conference with the discipline department teacher and plan on their pledge to improve the situation that they are in.

**Guiding Principles**

The four approaches to discipline are guided by 4 guiding principles ie. Character, **A**ffirmative but firm, **R**ole-modelling and **E**mpathetic and Developmental (CARE). These principles will be used as a guide or benchmark in the various approaches towards discipline.  
  
The first principles “**Character**” emphasizes on doing the right thing as well as upholding the school values, CLITE and putting into action the I-Care Tagline.  
  
The principle of “**Affirmative** **but firm**” highlights the strengths of the students and also addresses areas of concerns. Positives language is being used to channel the strength of the student from a destructive to a constructive behaviour. Desired outcomes and behaviour are communicated to students so that they set high standards of themselves.  
  
The next principle of “**Role-modelling**” means that teachers counsel or guide students to desired behaviour through good role-modelling and leading by examples.  
  
Finally the principle of “**Emphatic and developmental**” encourages teachers to make connections with students through empathetic listening. Positive teacher student relationship (TSR) is critical especially so when disciplinary measures are taken. Customisation of intervention strategies are also adopted especially when picked up by the Case Management Team (CMT).

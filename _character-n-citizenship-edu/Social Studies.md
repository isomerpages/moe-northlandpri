## SOCIAL STUDIES

Although Social Studies taught in primary schools is non-examinable, it plays a crucial role in citizen education among students. They are exposed to knowing about themselves and their community, understanding Singaporeâ€™s past and present, appreciating and understanding the region around Singapore and the world we live in. Students learn through inquiry-based approach and hands-on experiences. Learning journey is conducted for every level, bringing students to different heritage places , trails and museum visits.  
  
Social Studies seeks to instil in students a deeper understanding of the values that outline the Singapore society, nurture dispositions that will inspire them to show concern for the society and the world they live in, and demonstrate empathy in their relationships with others.

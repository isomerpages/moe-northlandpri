Dear Parents,

This is a gentle reminder of the upcoming Parent-Teacher meeting conducted online on 25 and 26 May, 8 a.m. to 4.30 p.m.

There will be no lessons conducted on these two days. Students are not required to come to school.

The June break will commence from 29 May to 25 June. Term 3 will start on 26 June, Monday.

We would like to wish you and your child a fruitful June break ahead.

Thank you and Regards.

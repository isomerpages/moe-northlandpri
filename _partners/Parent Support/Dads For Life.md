### Mission

To inspire, involve and equip fathers at NPS to become good influencers in their children’s lives for life

Children’s Time Spent With Fathers In Intact Families
Social expectations of the father’s role in the family have changed considerably in the past three decades. Previously expected to be mainly an economic provider, the “new father” now is expected to also provide day-to-day physical and emotional care to children as an equal partner of the mother (Goldscheider &amp; Waite, 1991)

### Key activities

* ICAN (Involvement – Consistency – Awareness – Nurturance) workshop
* 2D1N Sleepover with Dad
* Outdoor Activities with Dad
* Learn a skill from Dad

The programmes are designed to equip fathers with knowledge and skills for effective fathering.

## PREFECTS INVESTITURE 2016

The annual Prefects’ Investiture on Monday, 25 January not only marked the official appointment of the 2016 Prefectorial Board, it signified the immense exploits and contributions that our student leaders would accomplish in the course of the year. The eye-catching video montage showcasing the milestone programmes and projects by the prefects last year kept everyone glued to the screen with the captivating captions and quotes to illustrate the essence of leadership.  
  
During the investiture, both our principal, Mr Tony Tan and our newly-appointed head prefect, Xiao Zhen, , delivered powerful speeches to motivate the newly appointed school prefects to be value-driven leaders rooted in the spirit of excellence, commitment to serve with a purpose. Xiao Zhen exalted all prefects to hold their ground and stand strong on their beliefs and principles with a single-minded determination to serve willingly and exhibit exemplary behavior befitting a prefect.  
  
Excerpt from the Head Prefect’s speech  
  
‘We begin education as children, but we complete it as adults and no matter what we do, we will still face difficulties, and face them and solve them with your heads held high and hearts wide open. It is just a simple and short delay in your life, but if you submit to it and quit what you do, you are stopped forever.’  
  
The new investiture format which dovetailed the sequences of the investiture seamlessly had also absolutely enhanced the heartening experiences of all present during the ceremony to ensure memorable sweet after taste.

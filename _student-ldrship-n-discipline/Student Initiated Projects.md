## STUDENT INITIATED PROJECTS

Driven by the fact that leadership is a process, we put a heavy premium on the development of student leadership as these formative years of education and experiences would have lifelong impact in years to come.  
  
All student leaders would be trained and given vast opportunities in decision making when they are involved in the operational platform of our school ie daily activities and school events.  
  
They would be trained and given vast opportunities in decision making when they are involved in the operational platform of our school ie daily activities and school events. Workshops would be conducted with On the job training (OJTs) to build the quality of our student leadership base.  
  
As part of our effort to develop student leadership in our school, we want to improve the quality of our prefects through empowering them in the duties assigned. All prefects will go through a probation assessment process to address this issue of maintaining the quality of student leadership in our school.  
  
Our student leaders would be officially appointed as school prefects during the Prefectsâ€™ Investiture. Prior to their appointments, they had been involved in on the job training , ongoing workshops conducted on per term basis and an experiential learning cum assessment process to ascertain their suitability to be appointed as school prefects.  
  
Our school prefects are to be rooted in the spirit of excellence, commitment to serve and to enlarge their capacities in the midst of rising challenge of leading in a world of change. The newest members in our prefectorial board, our primary 2 peer leaders are also commissioned to serve our school.  
  
Our prefects are involved in many Student-Initiated projects, hosting school celebrations and commemoration events. Their involvements and services have not only been instrumental in meeting our school operational needs, they have also manifested true excellence, commitment and effectiveness in all their endeavours to serve the school.

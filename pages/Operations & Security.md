School Security &amp; Safety Measures

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only students in school uniform will be allowed into the school premises.

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All students would be dismissed via Gate C, D (Facing block 660) or gate F (Facing block 662). Students taking public transport are to leave via Gate C or D to the bus-stop using the covered link-way between blocks 660 and 661.

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school side Gates C, D &amp; F are strictly for students and staff. All visitors and parents are to come in by the main entrance via Gate B where the Security Post is situated. They are to obtain clearance from the Security Officers.

4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents are only allowed to drive into school to drop off their children between 6.45 am and 7.30 am. They are to alight their children at the front porch and drive off immediately. No cars are to be parked under the porch. If parents are to drop and/or pick their children outside NPS, they are advised to park at the designated HDB parking lots. Parents should not stop or park indiscriminately along the service road leading to the school or at the HDB car parks. Such actions can lead to unnecessary traffic congestion and pose safety issues to our students especially during school peak hours. Cooperation from parents is much appreciated.

5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents who wish to fetch their child after school dismissal, are to do so by waiting for their child at block 660 or 662. &nbsp;Please do not wait at Gates B, C, D &amp; F as this will hinder the free movement of staff and students. The Security Officers have been instructed to request for parents to move away from Gate B, C, D &amp; F.

6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students are not allowed to go out of the school compound to have their lunch if they have activities after school. Students are only allowed to go home to have their lunch with their parents if they have obtained an EXIT PASS from their Form teachers to leave school. Parents who need to hand over food to their child are to arrange with their child to pick it up from Gate B

7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents will not be allowed to enter the school premises to perform any form of chores such as feeding, washing, etc for the children. NPS believes that it is best to let the child manage this on his or her own. This includes not staying back in the canteen to observe your child eating. Should there be a specific need to remain in school to be with the student, parents are to make the special request through the Form teacher.

8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents are reminded to refrain from delivering non-critical items e.g water bottles, crayons, files, homework etc to their children. We would like students to learn to be self-reliant. We hope that parents will work closely with the school to help our students to learn to be independent and responsible.

9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visitors and parents coming into school for official business are required to scan their NRIC or Driving License for a Security Pass at the Security Post located between Gates A &amp; B. The Security Pass issued is to be displayed prominently at all times for identification purpose. Anyone found not displaying the Security Pass will be asked to leave the school premises immediately. Domestic helpers who are assigned to fetch students are required to have a photo-copied Work Permit to exchange for a Security Pass into NPS (eg unwell child).

10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operating hours of the General Office are from 8.00 am to 5.00 pm, Mon to Friday and as such the Security Officers would only allow visitors to enter the school premises from 8.00 am onwards. If parents need to consult their child’s teacher regarding his / her class work and homework, they are to call the school or teacher to make a prior appointment. The teacher will call back to attend to concerned parents’ queries and meeting appointment.

11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School Bookshop would be opened to serve the staff and students. It will be closed to parents from 8.30 am to 1.55 pm. Parents could visit the NPS Bookshop between 2.00 pm and 4.30 pm on school days. Parents are to register at the Security Post to exchange for a Security Pass B to enter the school to the bookshop. Parents are not allowed to remain in school after visiting the bookshop.

12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These above measures are taken to address the well-being, safety, and security of NPS students and staff. Support and cooperation from parents are deeply appreciated. For clarifications, please call the General Office or feedback to&nbsp;[https://forms.cwp.gov.sg/northlandpri/FormRERN8](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://forms.cwp.gov.sg/northlandpri/FormRERN8&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1683235311999555&amp;usg=AOvVaw0DsDlu9m_U5A_NWhDUdc8r).

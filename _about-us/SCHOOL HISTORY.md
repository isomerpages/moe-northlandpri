## SCHOOL HISTORY

Northland is the only school in Singapore built on the P107 design. Its unique building, wide front porch and spreading grounds have caused it to be called the school with “country club” look. 

Completed in 1987, it first opened its door to students on 2 January 1988. Its pupil population then was 800 in 20 classes ranging from primary one to primary five and, except for the primary one classes which were registered for Northland by Peixin and Xishan Primary Schools in the 1987 Primary One Registration Exercise.

The school was declared officially open on 17 April 1990 by Mr. Ng Pock Too, the then MP for Nee Soon Central Constituency. Its first Principal was Mrs Thio Soei Ho. Students had the option to offer Chinese, Malay or Tamil as the Mother Tongue language.

The school adopted a pragmatic approach in its efforts to establish itself. It put emphasis on two facets of education which parents were very concerned about – academic achievement and discipline. Teachers worked on the premise that all students can learn and can achieve. This philosophy has paid off. All cohorts of Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) students have performed consistently above the national average.

Dear Parents and Guardians,

Welcome to a brand new year at Northland Primary School. At Northland, we strongly believe in helping every child flourish by developing their positive self, nurturing positive relationships, and creating positive learning experiences that prepare them for life, not just for examinations. As Carol Dweck, who pioneered the idea of the growth mindset, reminds us, when children understand that their abilities can be developed through effort, good strategies and support, they become more resilient, more motivated and more willing to embrace challenges. This is the kind of mindset we hope to cultivate in every Northlander.

As we look ahead to 2026, we are excited about the kind of young person your child is becoming—not just in terms of academic achievements, but in the values, mindset and character they demonstrate each day. At Northland, we believe that true success comes when our students learn to choose effort over ease, kindness over anger, and integrity over shortcuts. These are the choices that shape who they are and who they will become, and they lie at the heart of the “we-first” spirit that defines our school community.

**Our Focus for 2026: Living the CLITE Values**

To support your child in this journey, our focus this year will be on nurturing the CLITE values of Compassion, Lifelong Learning, Integrity, Teamwork and Excellence. Anchored on these values, our programmes and experiences are designed to help every Northlander grow as both an empowered learner and a caring leader.

In school, your child will be encouraged to:

*   **Act with honesty and empathy** towards teachers and peers, building trust and strong relationships.
*   **Embrace challenges with curiosity and a growth mindset**, understanding that effort and perseverance lead to growth.
*   **Give their best effort in both big and small tasks**, recognising that doing small things well leads to big results.
*   **Work well with others and listen to different perspectives**, learning to collaborate, communicate, and value diverse strengths.
*   **Develop self-leadership** by reflecting on their actions, regulating their emotions, and taking ownership of their goals, time and responsibilities.

Through these daily choices, we hope our students will grow as self-directed learners, critical and creative thinkers, socially responsible leaders, and resilient, adaptable individuals who are ready for a changing future.

**Partnering Home and School**

We know that our efforts in school will have an even greater impact when they are reinforced at home. Your child is supported by a network of caring individuals—family, teachers, friends and mentors—and this partnership is central to the Northland story.

We therefore invite you to partner with us in helping your child live out these values daily—through your conversations with them, the expectations you set, and the encouragement you offer when they face challenges. Together, as home and school, we can build a strong “we-first” spirit around each child, so that they feel supported, guided and inspired to do their best.

**Our Hope for Every Northlander**

Our hope is that, with your partnership, your child will grow into an empowered learner, a caring leader and a person of integrity and character. As we continue to build on our strong collaborations with parents and the wider community, we remain committed to fostering joy and passion in learning, promoting critical and inventive thinking, and developing both performance and moral character in our children.

Thank you for walking this journey with us and for the trust you place in Northland. We look forward to working closely with you to make 2026 a meaningful and transformative year for your child, and to continue building new stories of success together.

Regards,
Jay

Welcome to Northland Primary School where we strongly believe in helping each and every child to flourish through developing their positive self, develop positive relationships and thrive in positive experiences that we provide for.

The eminent philosopher, John Dewey, once said, “Education is not preparation of life, Education is life itself.” He was convinced that learning through doing was the best approach to education and that it is an active and continual constructive process.

When our students are able to connect what they understand about their learning with the world around them, they will be truly educated.

Northlanders are given many opportunities to prepare them for life as we anchor our programmes based on our C-Lite values, help them develop learning dispositions and future skills as well as help them grow in areas they are passionate about.

Various platforms are also created to provide ample opportunities for our students to apply their learning and flourish. And through this application, we develop each and every child to be empowered learners and leaders. As empowered Northlanders, we will see our students become self-directed learners, critical and creative thinkers, social responsible leaders and resilient and adaptable individuals.

These outcomes are key in helping our students become future ready learners who need to learn deep competencies and cultivate habits of practices that will continue to be valuable long after graduation as the future landscapes of Singapore continue to evolve and change.

To help our students flourish as future ready learners, we will continue to build on our strong partnership with our parents and stakeholders to foster joy and passion in learning, promote critical and inventive thinking, and develop performance and moral character in our children.


The success story of Northland is not just about the stellar curriculum and programmes we cater but is mainly attributed to our people. Our efforts in building impactful collaborations with our stakeholders and community are a testimony to our commitment of partnership development for a community based approach to nurturing the whole child. With you supporting the strong and committed staff that we have, we would enable each and every child to grow, serve and excel and bring Northland Primary to greater heights.

Let us continue building new stories of success.

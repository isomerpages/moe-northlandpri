## CHAMPS IDENTITY

Our search for a meaningful identity led us to " **chamPS** ". The PS is in caps font and placed at the end of the name as it identifies our unified goal towards the school's vision by providing Parent Support. The smaller fonts of cham is an acronym for **Caring**, **Helping**, **Affirming** and **Mentoring**. These values are carefully chosen as they reflect (and constantly remind us) of a spirit of servitude and an earnest heart to reach out and make a difference. Only when we have a heart to care, willingness to step out to provide a helping hand, to proactively affirm with deeds and words the school's programs and to walk alongside each child & parent in mentoring - then we can say we are truly providing Parent Support.

When the acronyms of **cham** and **PS** are joined together - the message we want to highlight, as chamPS, will be - Parent Volunteers champion the cause of PSG towards the school's vision. Hence, the four action-oriented "heart-anchored" values lead to the philosophy of Parent Support - to be able to make a difference for the better even if it is for only a child, a parent or a teacher.

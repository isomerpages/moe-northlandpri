## WORKSHOPS AND SEMINARS

#### Preparing Your Child’s Transition to Secondary School

MOE has been organising **“Preparing Your Child’s Transition to Secondary School” Seminar** in the last few years to help parents understand the importance of parental support as their child transits from Primary to Secondary School. This year, parents will hear from a school leader, psychologist and parent who will share tips and information on how they can support their child in dealing with stress in the lead-up to PSLE, selecting a suitable secondary school and adapting to a secondary school life.

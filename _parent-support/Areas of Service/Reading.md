Timing : 12:45pm - 1:15pm (Term 2 /2014 - 10 lessons every wed in school hall)

**Note from the team:**<br>
Dizhigui is a set of standads that embraces compassion and harmony.  It provides concise guidelines on<br>
how we shold carry out our daily duties, instilling lifelong positive values in our kids.

Dizhigui teaches children to be dutiful to their parents, and respectful and  loving to their siblings.  <br>
It also teaches them to be cautious in their dealings with others in their daily lives

We are consciously working together as Parent Support Group, inculcating the right values and virtues in our children and bringing out the best in them. We strongly encourage your child to participate in the programme.

Please have your child bring along his/her own Dizhigui books.  For children who do not have the books, chamPS will<br>
prepare the materials for them

Should you have any enquiries or you wish to join us as a volunteer, please do not hesitate to contact our chamPS member, Mdm Jiangshu at [jiangshuesther@gmail.com](mailto:jiangshuesther@gmail.com)

Thank You for partnering with us

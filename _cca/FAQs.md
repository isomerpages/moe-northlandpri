##### FAQs for CCAs selection and operations

**How do I make an informed choice if there is no physical CCA Open House?**

For information pertaining to CCAs offered by the school, you may log on to the link
[https://northlandpri.moe.edu.sg/](https://northlandpri.moe.edu.sg/) to click on the heading ‘CCA’ in the Northland Primary School webpage. Then you can browse all the CCA webpages according to groups or individual CCAs. You can watch the eCCA Open House videos and information of each CCA to make an informed choice with your child before submitting the e-option google form.

**What if I am not given my first choice or any CCA of my choice at all?**

Due to the allocated number of students in each CCA with respect to our limited manpower, resources and venues, it is not possible for all students to be offered their first choices in CCAs as some CCAs may be oversubscribed. The reason for not offering more than 1 CCA in the same group for the e-option google form is to minimize overwhelming responses for certain groups too.

If you are not given your first choice CCA, we will try to give you another CCA which is one of your choices. Please take note that CCA allocation is not based on first come first serve order. CCA allocation will be made known in due course through your child’s form teachers.

**Can I switch CCA next year if I find that I do not feel comfortable to continue with the CCA allocated?**

We encourage all to stay in their same CCAs till primary 6. However, we can make exceptions if there are valid reasons eg medical or others. It is better for the students to remain in the same CCAs so that through consistent involvements and learning opportunities available, mastery of and progression in the skills can be acquired as compared to switching to another CCA. Even if the transfer takes place, it can only be **once** over the 4 years in our school.

**Can I not join any CCA for 2021?**

You are highly encouraged to join a CCA as our school strongly believes in giving our students a well-balanced and all-rounded education. Thus, we hope our students to not only excel in their studies but also to participate actively in co-curricular activities. 

Northland Primary School provides a wide range of CCAs to broaden and deepen our students’ foundations for lifelong learning incorporating holistic education for students to discover their strengths, interests and talents. 

It will also enrich your experiences and improve your social skills through interactions with friends beyond your classrooms.

**If I am selecting Robotics or Photography under Infocomm Club@Northland, what should I do?**

As Robotics and Photography wings are under Infocomm Club@Northland CCA, you just need to select the CCA. On the first day of the actual CCA session next year, the CCA teachers will ask you for your preference and you will join the wing of your preference accordingly.

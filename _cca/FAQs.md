## FAQS

##### FAQs for CCAs selection and operations

**How do I make an informed choice if there is no physical CCA Open House?**

For information pertaining to CCAs offered by the school, you may log on to the link
[https://northlandpri.moe.edu.sg/](https://northlandpri.moe.edu.sg/) to click on the heading ‘CCA’ in the Northland Primary School webpage. Then you can browse all the CCA webpages according to groups or individual CCAs. You can watch the eCCA Open House videos and information of each CCA to make an informed choice with your child before submitting the e-option google form.

**What if I am not given my first choice or any CCA of my choice at all?**

Due to the allocated number of students in each CCA with respect to our limited manpower, resources and venues, it is not possible for all students to be offered their first choices in CCAs as some CCAs may be oversubscribed. The reason for not offering more than 1 CCA in the same group for the e-option google form is to minimize overwhelming responses for certain groups too.

If you are not given your first choice CCA, we will try to give you another CCA which is one of your choices. Please take note that CCA allocation is not based on first come first serve order. CCA allocation will be made known in due course through your child’s form teachers.

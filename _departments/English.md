#### **Programmes**
##### **1.A Story is a Doorway (Extensive Reading Programme)**
Our school has adopted the tagline ‘A Story is a Doorway’, from the poem ‘A Story is a Doorway, by Richard Peck, for our Extensive Reading Programme. This is because reading opens the door to the world of knowledge, imagination and excitement.  
  
This programme aims to instil in students a lifelong passion for reading and develop appreciation for good literature.

**CORE**<br>
Integrated and holistic in its approach in areas of teaching and learning nurturing students to be self-directed, independent, enterprising, innovative and practical problem solvers. It is also aimed at building the confidence of our students to enable them to communicate their thoughts, ideas and feelings visually and verbally tapping on a varied range of resources.

*   Process Skills  
*   Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL)      
*   Understanding by Design (UbD)

**ENRICHMENT**<br>
The learning of science goes beyond the textbooks and the classroom. An integrated approach to teaching and learning leads the path to a more holistic education. Students should ideally be engaged in first-hand experiential learning. This not only provides a platform for identifying school leaders, but also enables students to explore areas unfamiliar yet exciting and intriguing for them. In this way would curiosity be piqued and heightened thus nurturing a culture of inquiry and the habits of mind.

In Northland, the science curriculum is supported and enriched by the following activities and facilities:

*   The Northland Young Scientist Badge (NYSB)  
*   Nature Trail/Learning Journeys  
*   Our Green Spaces  
*   E2K

**Sub-tabs for Our Green Spaces and E2K under Programmes.**

#### **Eco-Literacy Programmes**
**Our Green Spaces**
*   Enhance studentsâ€™ eco-literacy
*   Evoke the spirit of inquiry and stimulate curiosity
*   More opportunities for hands-on and experiential learning 
*   Providing a common trigger point for all students regardless of their socio-economic status (SES) 
*   A springboard to launch students into a world of self-discovery and wonder

#### 3) Programmes:

**MOE MP4**

MOE’s masterplan 4 focuses on quality learning and is aligned to MOE’s direction of Student-Centric and Values-Driven education. The vision of mp4 is to nurture “Future-ready and Responsible Digital Learners”. ICT is used productively for quality learning in support of the total curriculum - that is, to deepen subject mastery and develop 21st Century Competencies. As it was in mp3, there will be a strong focus on Cyber Wellness.

The goal of mp4 is to put “Quality Learning in the Hands of Every Learner - Empowered with Technology”. The two enablers are: 

1 \.  Teachers as Designers of Learning Experiences and Environments; and <br>
2 \.  School Leaders as Culture Builders
